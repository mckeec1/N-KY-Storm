            <br>
            <p>My name is Patrick Ciuccio. I am the current head coach for the Northern Kentucky Warriors High School lacrosse team. I played lacrosse for 8 years, and have coached for two. 
                I played at Cov Cath for 3 seasons, then for the Warriors my senior year. My freshman year of college I attended and played lacrosse at Eastern Kentucky University, then transferred to The University of Kentucky where I played the next 3 seasons.
                 I played defense, but one of my favorite moments in lacrosse was playing attack for a game against WKU, and scoring 3 goals and having 2 assists. </p>

            <br>
            <p>I started my lacrosse career in the 6th grade by enrolling into a indoor hosted by Laxland of Cincinnati. I loved the game from the start and never turned back. In the 7th grade I was part of the original group that started the Northern Kentucky Warriors. 
                I like to jokingly flaunt the fact that I scored the first goal in the programs history. While we did not win a game that first season, I am very proud of the resilience of the teammates we had. Our determination to get better propelled us all the way to the state championship the following season. 
                I continued to play lacrosse in high school at Covington Catholic. My lacrosse knowledge grew the most my freshman year of college while attending Mount Saint Joseph under coach Pat Kennedy. I then played the remainder of my lacrosse career at Eastern Kentucky University. 
                We were able to play in two division championship games and host the final four as the number one seed over three seasons in the NCLL. I was also a team captain during my final season.

                        I started playing lacrosse in 5th grade up in Medina, OH (Cleveland area). In high school, I was a 4 year varsity letter winner & my senior year of high school I was captain of our school's first ever girls lacrosse D1 state championship.
                         That year I was named to the all-district team.  I went to college at Miami University (OH) where I played club lacrosse, becoming captain my senior year. I graduated from Miami University in 2014 with a degree in Chemistry, 
                         and currently work as a full time chemist at Sun Chemical. I am also newly apart of the Notre Dame Academy program as of this year as an assistant varsity coach </p>
