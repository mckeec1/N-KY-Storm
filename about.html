                        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We are Northern Kentuckys first summer lacrosse club.</strong></p>
                        <br>
                        <p id="aboutText">The Kentucky Storm is Northern Kentucky's first summer lacrosse club. The goal of summer lacrosse is to assist players wanting to take their game to the next level. We give players the opportunity to compete with some of the best players from across the midwest and beyond. Our goal is to develop quality players through positive instruction, ample field play and honest player assessment from our dedicated coaching staff.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Summer lacrosse allows players who want to get in one more game, exposure to numerous college coaches from all levels (D1, D2, D3 and Independents). Since we are a Northern Kentucky based club we recruit from the area. This gives participants the chance to engage with their fellow players from the other local teams, making for a great experience for the players and their families. We know that the Northern Kentucky lacrosse community is small (but growing all the time), and not all players are on the same team for high school. A majority have played together in youth and middle school, summer lacrosse makes for a great opportunity to play together again. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We try to provide an affordable alternative to the national travel teams while still competing in the same tournaments.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our program is very family friendly, we realize summer is the opportunity for the family to have some much needed downtime. We are a family also, our program is set up to enhance your experience not become a source of pain and conflict.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We have a very easy summer schedule which is meant to enhance your summer experience. Our tournaments are located within driving distance, so no overnight lodging is necessary. Our practice schedule is twice a week for approximately an hour. We feel this is just enough to keep the skills sharp but not burn anyone (including parents) out.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        This summer we will be heading to Louisville and Mason. The tournaments are run by Lacrosse America, we have been with them for 3 years and like the format (a minimum of 4 games per tournament). Over the course of the two tournaments we play about the same as a full spring season. Thus giving players plenty of opportunity to be on the field and not on the sidelines. We limit the roster to 20-22 max!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In addition to being family friendly we strive to be wallet friendly, thus, the reason we don't do long travels which require overnight stays.  We have found the experience is the same whether we are in Louisville or Nashville, Mason or Chicago. The teams are the same, the college coaches are the same, the action is the same.
